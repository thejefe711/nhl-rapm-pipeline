NHL ANALYTICS TRANSPARENCY REPORT
========================================

RAPM EXPLANATION
----------------
RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus) Analysis:
- Measures each player's contribution to goal differential while on ice
- Adjusts for teammates and opponents using ridge regression
- 5v5 only to focus on even-strength play
- Per-60 minute rates for comparability across playing time

LATENT SKILLS EXPLANATION
-------------------------
Latent Skills (Sparse Autoencoder):
- Learns hidden patterns from 14 RAPM metrics
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving important information
- Identifies stable player traits (e.g., "Play driver", "Elite shutdown")
- Uses regularization to prevent overfitting

FORECASTING EXPLANATION
-----------------------
DLM Forecasting (Dynamic Linear Models):
- Kalman filter-based predictions of future performance
- Accounts for trend and uncertainty
- 95% confidence intervals show prediction reliability
- Adapts to recent performance changes

DATA SOURCES
------------
- NHL play-by-play data (events, shots, goals)
- Player shift data (on-ice combinations)
- Game results and scheduling data
- Advanced metrics computed via ridge regression

LIMITATIONS
-----------
- Based on available tracking data quality
- Small sample sizes for some players/seasons
- Correlation does not equal causation in statistical models
- Cannot capture unobservable factors (effort, coaching, etc.)

VALIDATION METHODS
------------------
- Cross-validation of model predictions
- Comparison against established NHL metrics
- Stability analysis of learned representations
- Outlier detection and data quality checks
